End-to-End Testing
It's important to walk a mile in our users' shoes—to test our applications and use them the way our users will. End-to-end (E2E) testing is the perfect tool for this job. With E2E testing, we evaluate our application from start to finish, creating tests based on real-world scenarios that our users would experience.

When writing end-to-end tests, it’s best to start by thinking about the flow of interactions in your application from start to finish. Imagine, for example, an Instagram-like application where users can post images to a public gallery. To create an E2E test for this, you would:

Navigate to the page where users can post an image.
Select the button that initiates the posting process and navigates to the "Post Image" page.
Upload an image, add a title, description, and tags.
Submit the image.
Verify that the page redirects to the new post and ensure all the content from the "Post Image" form is displayed correctly on the page.
By following this process, you can simulate the user journey and ensure your application behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.

Cypress
Cypress is a JavaScript testing framework that can be used for end-to-end testing, component testing, accessibility testing, UI coverage, and more. For this lesson, we will focus on its end-to-end testing features.

To learn more about Cypress's testing capabilities, check out their official documentation(opens in a new tab)

Cypress can be installed with npm install cypress --save-dev

To open the cypress test runner run  npx cypress open

This opens the Cypress Test Runner GUI, which makes end-to-end testing more visual compared to running tests in the console with Mocha. If the GUI isn’t your thing, you can always run Cypress tests in the console using npx cypress run

Running tests in the console is typically used when integrating Cypress with CI/CD pipelines
Cypress supports both end-to-end and component testing, but for this lesson, we'll focus on its end-to-end features.

Since most of our application's functionality happens in the browser, it's important to test in a browser environment. Cypress uses Electron as its default browser for running tests.

Out of the box, Cypress provides pre-built example tests for a wide range of features. If you're new to Cypress, we highly recommend exploring these examples to get a better understanding of the many ways you can implement testing with Cypress.

A "spec" in Cypress is a test file that contains the tests for your application. When generating a spec file using the Cypress Test Runner, it will automatically be added to the "e2e" folder.

Much like Mocha tests, Cypress tests begin with describe and it blocks. The describe block takes a string describing the test suite and a callback containing the suite logic. The it block includes a string describing the test case and a callback that contains the logic for the specific test case.

The approach to writing test cases is where unit tests and end-to-end tests differ. In Cypress, the logic in a test case should be more comprehensive, covering multiple features of the application from start to finish.
Cypress contains many commands, that can allow the tests to navigate and interact with your application.

DOM Interaction Command Examples:

cy.visit: Navigates to a given URL.
cy.get: Selects a DOM element.
cy.click: Performs a click event.
cy.type: Types text into an input field.
Assertions:
cy.should: Used to assert specific states, such as "be.visible" or "contain", someText.
For more commands and assertions check out Cypresses Documentation


Notes on best practices
Cypress has a number of best practices, all of which can be found in their documentation(opens in a new tab).

Some examples include:

Selecting elements using data-* attributes on elements.
Controlling your application state and testing specs in isolation.
